                <p class="my-6"><pre><strong>SKY-SWIFT LIMITED TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong>
These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between you and Sky-Swift that govern your use of the websites, applications, and other offerings from Sky-Swift limited.
The Sky-Swift limited Platform offers an online venue that enables users (“Members”) to publish, offer, search for, and book services. Members who publish and offer services are “Hosts” and Members who search for, book, or use services are “Guests.” Hosts offer accommodations (“Accommodations”), activities, excursions, and events (“Experiences”), and a variety of travel and other services (collectively, “Host Services,” and each Host Service offering, a “Listing”). You must register an account to access and use many features of the Sky-Swift, and must keep your account information accurate.
We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these Terms like our Privacy Policy, which describes our collection and use of personal data, and our Payments Terms, which govern any payment services provided to Members by the Sky-Swift limited payment entities ("Sky-Swift limited Payments").
If you Host, you are responsible for understanding and complying with all laws, rules, regulations and contracts with third parties that apply to your Host Services.

                <br><br><strong>Guest Terms</strong>
1. Our Mission.
Our mission is to offer first Class Hospitable services to Everyone with access to the best places to visit anywhere in the world. From cabins to castles to cooking classes, browse through millions of Listings to find the ones that fit the way you like to travel.
2. Searching and Booking on Sky-Swift Limited
2.1 Searching. You can search for Host Services by using criteria like the type of Host Service, travel destination, travel dates, and number of guests. You can also use filters to refine your search results. Search results are based on their relevance to your search and other criteria. Relevance considers factors like price, availability, Reviews, customer service and cancellation history, popularity, previous trips and saved Listings, Host requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights), and more. Learn more about search results in our Help Center.
2.2 Booking. When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your booking including the Listing price, applicable fees like Sky-Swift limited service fee, offline fees, taxes, and any other items identified during checkout (collectively, “Total Price”). You are also agreeing that Sky-Swift limited Payments may charge and collect any security deposit identified during checkout. When you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Host Services (sometimes called a reservation in these Terms) is formed. The cancellation policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the Listing or during checkout form part of your contract with the Host.
2.3 Accommodation Reservations. An Accommodation reservation is a limited license to enter, occupy, and use the Accommodation. The company’s property management retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation during your stay, to the extent: (i) it is reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the company and (iii) consistent with applicable law. If you stay past checkout, the company has the right to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law, including by imposing reasonable overstay penalties. You may not exceed the maximum number of allowed Guests.
2.4 Reservations for Experiences and Other Host Services.  You are responsible for confirming that you, and anyone you invite, meet minimum age, proficiency, fitness, or other requirements. You are responsible for informing the company of any medical or physical conditions, or other circumstances that may impact your ability to participate, attend, or use the Host Service. Except where expressly authorized, you may not allow any person to join a Host Service unless they are included as an additional guest during the booking process.
3. Cancellations, Travel Issues, Refunds and Booking Modifications.
3.1 Cancellations, Travel Issues, and Refunds. In general, if as a Guest you cancel a reservation, the amount refunded to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that reservation. But, in certain situations, other policies take precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you. If something outside your control forces you to cancel a reservation, you may be eligible for a partial or full refund under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy. If the Host cancels, or you experience a Travel Issue (as defined in our Guest Refund Policy), you may be eligible for rebooking assistance or a partial or full refund under the Guest Refund Policy. Different policies apply to certain categories of Listings; for example Experiences reservations are governed by the Experiences Guest Refund Policy. See each Policy for details about what is covered, and what refund applies in each situation.
3.2 Booking Modifications. Guests and Hosts are responsible for any booking modifications they agree to make via the Sky-Swift Platform or direct Sky-swift customer service to make on their behalf ("Booking Modifications"), and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees, or taxes associated with any Booking Modification.
4. Your Responsibilities and Assumption of Risk.
4.1 Your Responsibilities. You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join or provide access to any Accommodation, Experience or other Host Service. For example, this means: (i) you are responsible for leaving an Accommodation (and related personal property) in the condition it was in when you arrived, and (ii) you must act with integrity, treat others with respect, and comply with applicable laws at all times. If you are booking for an additional guest who is a minor or if you bring a minor to a Host Service, you must be legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor and you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor.
4.2 Your Assumption of Risk. You acknowledge that many activities carry inherent risks and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Sky-Swift limited Platform and any Content , including your stay at any Accommodation, participation in any Experience, use of any other Host Service, or any other interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online. This means it is your responsibility to investigate a Host Service to determine whether it is suitable for you. For example, Host Services may carry risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those Host Services.
Host Terms
5. Hosting on Sky-Swift
5.1 Host. As a Host, Sky-Swift limited offers you the opportunity to share your Accommodation, Experience, or other Host Service with our vibrant community of Guests - and earn money doing it. It’s easy to create a Listing and you are in control of how you host - set your price, availability, and rules for each Listing.
5.2 Contracting with Guests. When you accept a booking request, or receive a booking confirmation through the Sky-Swift limited Platform, you are entering into a contract directly with the Guest, and are responsible for delivering your Host Service under the terms and at the price specified in your Listing. You are also agreeing to pay applicable fees like Sky-Swift’s service fee (and applicable taxes) for each booking. Sky-Swift  Payments will deduct amounts you owe from your payout unless we and you agree to a different method. Any terms, policies or conditions that you include in any supplemental contract with Guests must: (i) be consistent with these Terms, our Policies, and the information provided in your Listing, and (ii) be prominently disclosed in your Listing description.
5.3 Independence of Hosts. Your relationship with Sky-Swift limited is that of an independent individual or entity and not an employee, agent, joint venture, or partner of Sky-Swift, except that Sky-Swift limited Payments acts as a payment collection agent as described in the Payments Terms.
6. Managing Your Listing.
6.1 Creating and Managing Your Listing. The Sky-Swift limited Platform provides tools that make it easy for you to set up and manage a Listing. Your Listing must include complete and accurate information about your Host Service, your price, other charges like cleaning fees, resort fees, security deposits, offline fees, and any rules or requirements that apply to your Guests or Listing. You are responsible for keeping your Listing information (including calendar availability) and content (like photos) up-to-date and accurate at all times. We recommend that you obtain appropriate insurance for your Host Services and suggest you carefully review policy terms and conditions including coverage details and exclusions. You may only maintain one Listing per Accommodation, but may have multiple Listings for a single property if it has multiple places to stay.
6.2 Know Your Legal Obligations. You are responsible for understanding and complying with any laws, rules, regulations, and contracts with third parties that apply to your Listing or Host Services. For example: Some landlords and leases, or homeowner and condominium association rules, restrict or prohibit subletting, short-term rentals and/or longer-term stays. Some cities have zoning or other laws that restrict the short-term rental of residential properties. Some jurisdictions require Hosts to register, get a permit, or obtain a license before providing certain Host Services (such as short-term rentals, longer-term stays, preparing food, serving alcohol for sale, guiding tours, or operating a vehicle). In some places, the Host Services you want to offer may be prohibited altogether. Some jurisdictions require that you register Guests who stay at your Accommodation. Some jurisdictions have laws that create tenancy rights for Guests and additional obligations for Hosts. For example, some places have landlord-tenant, rent control, and eviction laws that may apply to longer stays. Check your local rules to learn what rules apply to the Host Services you plan to offer. Information we provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should independently confirm your obligations. You are responsible for handling and using personal data of Guests and others in compliance with applicable privacy laws and these Terms, including our Host Privacy Standards. If you have questions about how local laws apply you should always seek legal advice.
6.3 Search Ranking. The ranking of Listings in search results on the Sky-Swift limited Platform depends on a variety of factors, including these main parameters:
•	Guest search parameters (e.g. number of Guests, time and duration of the trip, price range),
•	Listing characteristics (e.g. price, calendar availability, number and quality of images, Reviews, type of Host Service, Host status, age of the Listing, average Guest popularity),
•	Guest booking experience (e.g. customer service and cancellation history of the Host, ease of booking),
•	Host requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights, booking cut-off time), and
•	Guest preferences (e.g. previous trips, saved Listings, location from where the Guest is searching).
Search results may appear different on our mobile application than they appear on our website. Sky-Swift limited may allow Hosts to promote their Listings in search or elsewhere on the Sky-Swift limited Platform by paying an additional fee. More information about the factors that determine how your Listing appears in search results, our current promotional programs (if any), and how we identify promoted Content can be found in our Help Center.
6.4 Your Responsibilities. You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you allow to participate in providing your Host Services. You are responsible for setting your price and establishing rules and requirements for your Listing. You must describe any and all fees and charges in your Listing description and may not collect any additional fees or charges outside the Sky-Swift limited Platform. Do not encourage Guests to create third-party accounts, submit reviews, provide their contact information, or take other actions outside the Sky-Swift limited Platform.

6.5 Hosting as a Team or Organization. If you work with a co-host or host as part of a team, business, or other organization, the entity and each individual who participates in providing Host Services is responsible and liable as a Host under these Terms. If you accept terms or enter into contracts, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into contracts for and bind your team, business or other organization, and that each entity you use is in good standing under the laws of the place where it is established. If you perform other functions, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to perform those functions. If you instruct Sky-Swift limited to transfer a portion of your payout to a co-host or other Hosts, or to send payments to someone else, you must be authorized to do so, and are responsible and liable for the payment amounts and accuracy of any payout information you provide.
6.6 Your Assumption of Risk. You acknowledge that hosting carries inherent risks and agree that you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Sky-Swift Platform, offering Host Services, or any interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online. You agree that you have had the opportunity to investigate the Sky-Swift Platform and any laws, rules, regulations, or obligations that may be applicable to your Listings or Host Services and that you are not relying upon any statement of law made by Sky-Swift.
7. Cancellations, Travel Issues, and Booking Modifications.
7.1 Cancellations and Travel Issues. In general, if a Guest cancels a reservation, the amount paid to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that reservation. As a host, you should not cancel on a Guest without a valid reason under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy or applicable law. If you cancel on a Guest without such a valid reason, we may impose a cancellation fee and other consequences. If: (i) a Guest experiences a Travel Issue (as defined by the Guest Refund Policy), (ii) an Extenuating Circumstance arises, or (iii) a reservation is cancelled under these Terms, the amount you are paid will be reduced by the amount we refund or otherwise provide to the Guest, and by any other reasonable costs we incur as a result of the cancellation. If a Guest receives a refund after you have already been paid, or the amount of the refund and other costs incurred by Sky-Swift limited exceeds your payout, Sky-Swift (via Sky-Swift limited Payments) may recover that amount from you, including by offsetting the refund against your future payouts. You agree that Sky-Swift’s Guest Refund Policy, Extenuating Circumstances Policy, and these Terms preempt the cancellation policy you set in situations where they allow for the cancellation of a reservation and/or the issuance of refunds to Guests. If we reasonably expect to provide a refund to a Guest under one of these policies, we may delay release of any payout for that reservation until a refund decision is made. If you Host an Experience please note that the Experience Cancellation Policy, Experiences Guest Refund Policy and different cancellation fees and consequences apply to your reservations. See each Policy for details about what is covered, and what your payout will be in each situation.
7.2 Booking Modifications. Hosts and Guests are responsible for any Booking Modifications they agree to make via the Sky-Swift limited Platform or direct Sky-Swift customer service to make on their behalf, and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees or taxes associated with a Booking Modification.
8. Taxes.
8.1 Host Taxes. As a host, you are responsible for determining and fulfilling your obligations under applicable laws to report, collect, remit, or include in your price any applicable VAT or other indirect taxes, occupancy taxes, tourist, income, or other taxes ("Taxes").
8.2 Collection and Remittance by Sky-Swift limited . In jurisdictions where Sky-Swift limited  facilitates the collection and/or remittance of Taxes on behalf of Hosts, you instruct and authorize Sky-Swift limited  to collect Taxes on your behalf, and/or to remit such Taxes to the relevant Tax authority. Any Taxes that are collected and/or remitted by sky-swift are identified to Members on their transaction records, as applicable. Sky-Swift may seek additional amounts from Members (including by deducting such amounts from future payouts) in the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge that Members’ tax obligations, and you agree that your sole remedy for Taxes collected by Sky-Swift is a refund from the applicable Tax authority. You acknowledge and agree that we retain the right, with prior notice to affected Members, to cease the collection and remittance of Taxes in any jurisdiction for any reason.
8.3 Tax Information. In certain jurisdictions, Tax regulations may require that we collect and/or report Tax information about you, or withhold Taxes from payouts to you, or both. If you fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to support any such obligation to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we may withhold payouts up to the amount as required by law, until sufficient documentation is provided. You agree that Sky-Swift Limited may issue on your behalf invoices or similar documentation for VAT, GST, consumption or other Taxes for your Host Services to facilitate accurate tax reporting by you, our Guests, and/or their organizations.

               <br><br> <strong>General Terms</strong><br>
9. Reviews.
After each Host Service, Guests and Hosts will have an opportunity to review each other. Your Review must be accurate and may not contain any discriminatory, offensive, defamatory, or other language that violates our Content Policy or Review Policy. Reviews are not verified by Sky-Swift Limited for accuracy and may be incorrect or misleading.
10. Content.
Parts of the Sky-Swift Limited  Platform enable you to provide feedback, text, photos, audio, video, information, and other content (collectively, “Content”). By providing Content, in whatever form and through whatever means, you grant Sky-Swift a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, sub-licensable and transferable license to copy, modify, prepare derivative works of, distribute, publish and otherwise exploit, that Content, without limitation. If Content includes personal information, our Privacy Policy describes how we use that personal information. Where Sky-Swift Limited  pays for the creation of Content or facilitates its creation, Sky-Swift  may own that Content, in which case supplemental terms or disclosures will say that. You are solely responsible for all Content that you provide and warrant that you either own it or are authorized to grant sky-swift the rights described in these Terms. You are responsible and liable if any of your Content violates or infringes the intellectual property or privacy rights of any third party. Content must comply with our Content Policy and Nondiscrimination Policy, which prohibit, among other things, discriminatory, obscene, harassing, deceptive, violent, and illegal content. You agree that Sky-swift may make available services or automated tools to translate Content and that your Content may be translated using such services or tools. Sky-Swift does not guarantee the accuracy or quality of translations and Members are responsible for confirming the accuracy of such translations.
11. Fees.
Sky-Swift  may charge fees (and applicable Taxes) to Hosts and Guests for use of the sky-swift Platform. More information about when service fees apply and how they are calculated can be found on our Service Fees page. Except as otherwise provided on the sky-swift Platform, service fees are non-refundable. Sky-swift reserves the right to change the service fees at any time, and will provide Members notice of any fee changes before they become effective. Fee changes will not affect bookings made prior to the effective date of the fee change. If you disagree with a fee change you may terminate this agreement at any time.

13.2 Termination. You may terminate this agreement at any time by sending us an email or by deleting your account. Sky-swift may terminate this agreement and your account for any reason by giving you 30 days’ notice via email or using any other contact information you have provided for your account.

15. Resolving Complaints and Damage Claims.
If a Member provides evidence that another Member damaged their real or personal property ("Damage Claim"), the complaining Member can seek compensation through the Resolution Center. If the complaining Member escalates a Damage Claim to sky-swift, the other Member will be given an opportunity to respond. If the responding Member agrees to pay, or sky-swift determines in its sole discretion that they are responsible for the Damage Claim, sky-swift via sky-swift Payments can collect any sums required to cover the Damage Claim from the responding Member and/or against any security deposit. You agree that sky-swift may seek to recover from you under any insurance policies you maintain and that sky-swift may also pursue against you any remedies it may have available under applicable law. You agree to cooperate in good faith, provide any information sky-swift requests, execute documents, and take further reasonable action, in connection with Damage Claims, Member complaints, claims under insurance policies, or other claims related to your provision or use of Host Services.
16. Sky-Swift’s Role.
We offer a platform that enables Members to publish, offer, search for, and book Host Services. While we work hard to ensure our Members have great experiences, we do not and cannot control the conduct of Guests and Hosts. You acknowledge that sky-swift has the right, but does not have any obligation, to monitor the use of the sky-swift Platform and verify information provided by our Members. For example, we may review, disable access to, remove, or edit Content to: (i) operate, secure and improve the sky-swift Platform (including for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation and customer support purposes); (ii) ensure Members’ compliance with these Terms; (iii) comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body; (iv) address Content that we determine is harmful or objectionable; (v) take actions set out in these Terms; and (vi) maintain and enforce any quality or eligibility criteria, including by removing Listings that don’t meet quality and eligibility criteria. Members acknowledge and agree that Sky-Swift administers its Policies (such as our Extenuating Circumstances Policy) and Standards (such as basic requirements for hosts), including decisions about whether and how to apply them to a particular situation, at its sole discretion. Members agree to cooperate with and assist sky-swift in good faith, and to provide sky-swift with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by sky-swift with respect to any investigation undertaken by sky-swift regarding the use or abuse of the sky-swift Platform. Sky-swift is not acting as an agent for any Member except for where sky-swift Payments acts as a collection agent as provided in the Payments Terms.
17. Member Accounts.
You must register an account to access and use many features of the Sky-swift Platform. Registration is only permitted for legal entities, partnerships and natural persons who are 18 years or older. You represent and warrant that you are not a person or entity barred from using the sky-swift Platform under the laws of the United States, your place of residence, or any other applicable jurisdiction. You must provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and keep your account information up-to-date. You may not register more than one account or transfer your account to someone else. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your account credentials and may not disclose your credentials to any third party. You are responsible and liable for activities conducted through your account and must immediately notify Sky-Swift if you suspect that your credentials have been lost, stolen, or your account is otherwise compromised. If and as permitted by applicable law, we may, but have no obligation to (i) ask you to provide identification or other information, (ii) undertake checks designed to help verify your identity or background, (iii) screen you against third-party databases or other sources and request reports from service providers, and (iv) obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations or their local equivalents.
18. Disclaimer of Warranties.
We provide the Sky-Swift Platform and all Content “as is” without warranty of any kind and we disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied. For example: (i) we do not endorse or warrant the existence, conduct, performance, safety, quality, legality or suitability of any Guest, Host, Host Service, Listing or third party; (ii) we do not warrant the performance or non-interruption of the sky-swift Platform; and (iii) we do not warrant that verification, identity or background checks conducted on Listings or Members (if any) will identify past misconduct or prevent future misconduct. Any references to a Member or Listing being "verified" (or similar language) indicate only that the Member or Listing or sky-swift has completed a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else. The disclaimers in these Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. If you have statutory rights or warranties we cannot disclaim, the duration of any such statutorily required rights or warranties, will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

19. Limitations on Liability.
Neither Sky-Swift (including its affiliates and personnel) nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the sky-swift Platform or any Content will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with (i) these Terms, (ii) the use of or inability to use the sky-swift Platform or any Content, (iii) any communications, interactions or meetings you may have with someone you interact or meet with through, or as a result of, your use of the sky-swift Platform, or (iv) publishing or booking of a Listing, including the provision or use of Host Services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not sky-swift has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set out in these Terms is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
Except for our obligation to transmit payments to Hosts under these Terms, or make payments under the sky-swift Host Guarantee or Japan Host Insurance, in no event will sky-swift’s aggregate liability for any claim or dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms, your interaction with any Members, or your use of or inability to use the sky-swift Platform, any Content, or any Host Service, exceed: (A) to Guests, the amount you paid as a Guest during the 12-month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, (B) to Hosts, the amount paid to you as a Host in the 12-month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or (C) to anyone else, one hundred U.S. dollars (US$100) or Ksh.10,000.
