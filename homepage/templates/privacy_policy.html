                <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
Your privacy is important to us. You place your trust in us by using Sky-swift.com services and we value that trust. That means we’re committed to protecting and safeguarding any personal data you give us. We act in our customers’ best interest and we are transparent about the processing of your personal data.
This document describes what we use, how we use and process your personal data and for what purpose. It also tells you what rights you can exercise in relation to your personal data (such as the right to object) and how you can contact us.
We might amend the Privacy Statement from time to time, so we recommend you visit this page occasionally to make sure you know where you stand. If we make any changes to the Privacy Statement that will have an impact on you (for example, if we intend to process your personal data for other purposes than previously communicated), we’ll notify you of these changes before the new activities begin.
And now, the sad but necessary bit: If you disagree with this Privacy Statement, you should discontinue using our services. If you agree with our Privacy Statement, then you’re all set to book your next trip through us.

                <h4>TERMS WE USE IN THIS STATEMENT</h4>
Trip' means the various different travel products and services that can be ordered, acquired, purchased, bought, paid, rented, provided, reserved, combined, or consummated by you from the Trip Provider.
Trip Provider' means the provider of accommodation (e.g. hotel, motel, apartment, bed & breakfast, landlord), attractions (e.g. (theme) parks, museums, sightseeing tours), transportation provider (e.g. car rentals, cruises, rail, airport rides, coach tours, transfers), tour operators, travel insurances and any other travel or related product or service as from time to time available for Trip Reservation on the platform.
Trip Service' means the online purchase, order, (facilitated) payment or reservation service as offered or enabled by Sky-swift.com in respect of various products and services as from time to time made available by Trip Providers on the platform.
Trip Reservation' means the order, purchase, payment, booking or reservation of a Trip.



<h4>WHAT KIND DATA DO WE COLLECT?</h4>
We can’t help you book the perfect Trip without information, so when you use our services there are certain things we ask for. This is typically routine information – your name, preferred contact details, the names of the people travelling with you and your payment information. You might also decide to submit additional information related to your upcoming Trip (for example, your anticipated arrival time).
In addition to this, we also collect information from the computer, phone, tablet or other device you use to access our services. This includes the IP address, the browser you’re using and your language settings. There are also situations in which we receive information about you from others or when we automatically collect other information.
The following is the data that we collect
•	When you make a Trip Reservation, you are (at a minimum) asked for your name and email address.
•	Depending on the Trip Reservation, we may also ask for the names of the people travelling with you and any preferences you might have for your Trip (such as dietary or accessibility requirements).
•	Your contact with us, such as when you: call us or interact with us through social media, website, and email (we may record your conversations, social media or other interactions with us).
•	Data from reviews you’ve written to help inform others about the experiences you had on your Trip. When you write a review on the Sky-swift.com platform, we’ll collect any information you’ve included, along with your display name and avatar (if you choose one).
•	If you’re browsing with your mobile device, you can decide to allow Sky-swift.com to see your current location or grant us access to your contacts. This helps us to give you the best possible service and experience by, for example, showing you our city guides, suggesting the nearest restaurants or attractions to your location or making other recommendations.
•	When you create a user account, we’ll also store your personal settings, uploaded photos, and reviews of previous bookings. This saved data can be used to help you plan and manage future Trip Reservations or benefit from other features only available to account holders (such as incentives or other benefits).
                <h4>PERSONAL DATA YOU GIVE US ABOUT OTHERS.</h4>
Of course, you might not simply be making a Trip Reservation for yourself. You might be taking a Trip with other people or making a reservation on someone else’s behalf. In both those scenarios, you will provide their details as part of the Trip Reservation
At this point, we have to make it clear that it’s your responsibility to ensure that the person or people you have provided personal data about are aware that you’ve done so, and that they have understood and accepted how Sky-swift.com uses their information (as described in this Privacy Statement).

                <h4>PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY.</h4>
Whether or not you end up making a Trip Reservation, when you visit our websites we automatically collect certain information. This includes your IP address, the date and time you accessed our services, and information about your computer’s hardware and software (such as the operating system, the internet browser used, software/application version data and your language settings). We also collect information about clicks and which pages have been shown to you.
If you’re using a mobile device, we collect data that identifies the device, as well as data about your device-specific settings and characteristics, app crashes and other system activity. When you make a Trip Reservation using this kind of device, our system registers how you made your reservation (on which website), and/or which site you came from when you entered the Sky-swift.com website or app.
Personal data we receive from other sources.
It’s not just the things you tell us, though – we may also receive information about you from other sources. These include business partners, such as affiliate partners, subsidiaries of         Sky-swift Kenya Limited.
We also integrate with third party service providers to facilitate payments between you and Trip Providers. These service providers share payment information so we can administer and handle your Trip Reservation, making sure everything goes as smoothly as possible for you.
Additionally, we collect information in the regrettable case that we receive a complaint about you from a Trip Provider, for example in the case of misconduct.
We may also receive information about you in order to show you more relevant ads, such as the additional cookie data Sky-swift.com social media partners make available to us.
When you link your Sky-swift.com user account to a social media account, you yourself might exchange data between Sky-swift.com and that social media provider. You can always choose not to share that data.
Trip Providers may share information about you with Sky-swift.com, too. This could happen if you have support questions about a pending Trip Reservation, or if disputes or other issues arise about a Trip Reservation.
